## Overview
In this project I aim to create functional etch-a-sketch minigame, where user can draw squares with multiple colors on a square grid.

## Problem
Make a program where user can interact with page, draw within square grid and access different colors.

## Tools
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

## Status
Started 11.05.2023
Currently working on it.

## Conclusion
This project was fun. I learned DOM manipulation and some CSS rules. I want to dig deeper into JS and make more difficult projects in the future, but that was a good step forward. I'll keep my code as it is, it'll be a good reference point. 
Thank you for reading.
